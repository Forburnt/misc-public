00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.080
That's horrible...!

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.500
There's no helping it.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.460
This was too much for her to handle alone.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.170
But she came here knowing that.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.770
But... that's too much!
This can't be right!

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.690
If she gives up, it's over.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.530
But you have the power
to change fate itself...

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.080
All this inevitable destruction
and tragedy...

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.040
You can change it, if you want.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.550
The power to do so lies within you.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.430
Can I really?

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.060
Can I really do something to help?

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.020
Could I really change this ending?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.480
Of course you could.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.690
So make a contract with me...

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.650
...and become a magical girl!

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.210
It was all just a dream?

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.630
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.930
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.850
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.640
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.740
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.870
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.710
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.800
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.920
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.850
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.140
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.480
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.900
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.200
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.620
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.750
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.460
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.800
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.390
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.430
EPISODE 1: I FIRST MET HER IN A DREAM... OR SOMETHING

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.770
Good morning, Dad!

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.440
Good morning, Madoka.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.650
Is Mom up?

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.270
Tatsuya's waking her up right now.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.570
Go help him, will you?

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.110
Okay!

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.070
Mommy! Mommy!

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.950
Morning! Morning!

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.160
Wake up! Mommy! Mommy!

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.090
RISE AND SHINE!

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.260
Huh?

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.340
Mommy woke up!

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.220
So what's been going on lately?

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.770
Hitomi got another love letter.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.020
That's the second one this month.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.570
Boys who don't even have the guts to
confess their love in person are no good.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.450
And how's Kazuko doing?

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.030
It seems like Ms. Saotome's new
relationship is going well.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.450
She gushes about him
all during homeroom.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.040
It'll be their 3-month anniversary this
week, so I guess that's a new record.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.290
Hmm, I guess we'll see.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.670
They're reaching a crucial
juncture right now.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.920
They are?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.640
If it's not the real thing,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.550
it's around this point in the relationship
that things start falling apart.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.640
Well, if they make it past 3 months, they're
probably good a year at least.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.650
Perfect!

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.320
Which ribbon should I wear?

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.030
Huh? But isn't this too flashy?

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.160
That's at LEAST as flashy as you should be!

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.870
A woman's appearance is the one thing
she can't afford to get looked down at.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.380
Excellent!

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.760
That should make all your secret
admirers melt in adoration.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.050
I don't have any secret admirers!

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.300
But you should go about as though you do.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.770
That's the secret behind every
pretty girl's success!

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.150
Uh-oh!

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.070
Safe!

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.400
There, eat it all up now, okay?

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.700
Okay!

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.530
More coffee, honey?

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.450
Hmm, better not.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.010
All right! I'm off then.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.510
Have a nice day!

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.350
Now then, you'd better hurry too, Madoka.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.270
Huh?! Oh, right!

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.860
I'm heading out!

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.940
Have a nice day, sweetie!

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.150
Have nice daaaay!

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.370
Good morning!

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.670
Good morning.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.460
Madoka, you're late!

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.130
Oh! Cute ribbons!

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.710
You think so? They're not too flashy?

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.220
I think they look lovely.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.020
So my mom said...

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.610
A boy who confesses his love with a letter
instead of in person is no good.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.610
Your mom is just too cool, Madoka!

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.610
I mean, she's gorgeous and a successful
businesswoman besides!

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.620
If only I could make up my mind
to reject a boy so easily.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.700
What an enviable problem to have!

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.410
It really is! I wish I could get a
love letter from someone too.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.290
Just once!

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.630
Oh-ho!

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.670
So you want to become a beautiful,
popular girl like Hitomi, Madoka?

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.840
And you've decided to start changing your
image with these hair ribbons, huh?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.760
You've got it wrong! My mom made me--

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.600
I see! You even got your mom to tell
you the secret to becoming popular!

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.640
How shameless!

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.680
Let me show you what happens
to bad girls like you!

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.440
No! Hey! Stop it! Stop!

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.190
My, such a cute girl!

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.690
But I won't allow you to go off and
become popular with the boys.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.150
You must be my bride, Madoka!!

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.360
Noooo!

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.830
Ahem!

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.960
Now, I have something very important
to discuss with you today, class.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.210
I want you all to listen very closely!

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.250
When frying an egg, should it be fried
sunny side-up or over hard?!

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.460
Mr. Nakazawa--what do you think?!

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.300
Huh?! U-um, well--

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.590
Th-they can be fried either way, can't they?

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.260
Precisely!

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.970
They can be fried either way!

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.720
And it should go without saying...

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.390
...that judging a woman's attractiveness...

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.980
...by the way she fries her eggs
is the gravest of mistakes!

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.770
Now, girls--

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:27.520
I want you to remember...

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.070
...that you must never date men who insist
they can't eat fried eggs done over hard.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.570
Guess it didn’t work out.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.740
Yeah, guess it didn't.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.440
And boys--

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.950
You'd better not grow up so petty as to
fuss over how your eggs are done, okay?

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:41.620
Well, then!

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.040
Now that that's out of the way, let's
welcome our new transfer student!

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.330
Hey, shouldn't that have come first?

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.250
Come on in, Miss Akemi!

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.220
Wow, she's gorgeous!

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.340
Huh?

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.470
No way... It couldn't be...

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.640
Now, then! Why don't you tell your
classmates about yourself?

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.150
My name is Homura Akemi.
Pleased to meet you.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.910
HOMURA AKEMI

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.260
Uh... Miss Akemi?

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.680
So, Miss Akemi...

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.680
What school did you come from?

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.270
A Catholic school in Tokyo.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.230
Did you do any club activities
at your old school?

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.020
How about sports? Or cultural activities?

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.190
I didn't participate in activities.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.280
Your hair is so beautiful!

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.240
What kind of shampoo do you use?

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.320
She has a mysterious air
to her, doesn't she?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.990
Hey, Madoka, do you know that girl?

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.710
Maybe it was just me, but it seemed
like she was glaring at you earlier.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.250
Well... Um...

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.830
I'm sorry.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.250
I think today's been a
little stressful for me.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.750
I'm not feeling very well.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.920
Would you allow me to excuse
myself to the Nurse's Office?

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.510
Oh! Then let me show you the way there.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.350
I'll come too!

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.100
No, you needn't trouble yourselves.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.470
I'll ask the Nurse's Aide to take me.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.440
Miss Madoka Kaname.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.530
You are the Nurse's Aide for
this class, are you not?

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.700
Huh? Um, well...

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.160
May I ask you to accompany me?

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.450
To the Nurse's Office, that is.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.840
U-um, I, uh...

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.840
How did you know I was the Nurse's Aide?

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.640
Ms. Saotome told me.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.220
Oh, I see.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.350
Oh, um, the Nurse's Office is...

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.640
This way, isn't it?

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.600
Yes, that's right.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.110
Um, but... um...

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.610
It seems like you already
know how to get there...

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.660
Um... Miss Akemi?

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.580
You can call me Homura.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.630
Homura...?

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.500
What is it?

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.130
Oh, um...

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.670
That's kind of an unusual name, isn't it?

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.840
O-oh!

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.890
But not in a bad way! I-I was just
thinking it sounded kind of cool--

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.730
Madoka Kaname.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.150
Do you treasure the life you currently live?

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.110
Do you consider your family
and friends precious?

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:13.450
W-well... I... Yes, I do.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.080
Both my family and my friends--

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.290
I love all of them, and consider
them very precious!

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.000
Do you really?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.460
Yes, really! I couldn't lie about that.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.760
I see.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.340
If that's really the case,

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.640
then you wouldn't try to change the person
you currently are, would you?

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.940
Because if you do, you will end
up losing all of those things.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.140
...Huh?

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.730
You should stay as you
are, Madoka Kaname.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.650
Stay as you are, and as
you always shall be.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.690
D-did she just break the
prefecture-wide record...?

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.400
You were so amazing!

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.010
Huh?! She said WHAT?!

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.890
It doesn't make any sense, does it?

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.430
Just when I was thinking she was someone
gifted with both brains and beauty...

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.140
...it turns out she's a crazy
New Age weirdo!

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.770
Exactly how far was she going to keep
up that weirdo character act?

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.070
Is that what gets her MOE?! How
the heck is that even exciting?!

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.570
Madoka, are you sure you've never
met Miss Akemi before?

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.360
Hmm... Well, the sensible
answer is, "yes," but...

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.280
What's that supposed to mean?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.580
That you have met her before
in some "insensible" way?

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.410
Well...

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.830
Last night... I first met her... in a dream...

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.120
Or something.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.710
Awesome! You’re acting like you’re
a anime character, too!

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.840
That's mean! This is really bugging me!

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.340
Well, it's all obvious now!

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.220
You must have known each
other in a previous life,

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.720
and were brought by fate across time
and space to meet once again!

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.680
You said you met in a dream.
What kind of dream was it?

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.560
It was... To be honest, I can't
really remember anymore.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.190
I do know that it was a really
strange dream, though...

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:52.200
Then maybe you actually have met
Miss Akemi somewhere before.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.200
Huh?!

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.200
Though you may not
consciously remember,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.200
your subconscious could
have taken note of her...

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.460
...and later brought her
image out in a dream.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.830
Isn't that a little far-fetched? I mean,
that's some coincidence!

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.380
I suppose.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.010
Oh! It's already this late?

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.670
I'm sorry, I'd better go.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.800
Piano lessons, right? Or is it Japanese
classical dance today?

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.300
Tea Ceremony lessons.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.970
Even though Entrance Exams
are right around the corner.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.390
I wonder how long Mother intends
to make me continue with them.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.270
Whew! Makes me glad I wasn't born rich.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.690
Should we get going too?

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.530
Madoka, do you mind if we stopped at
the music store on the way home?

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.780
That's fine. Buying another CD for Kamijo?

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.320
Sort of.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.990
Well, see you later.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.160
- Later!
- Bye-bye!

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.320
Help me...

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.330
Help me... Madoka...

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.750
Huh? What?!

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.790
Please... save me...

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.510
Who's there? Who is it?

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.130
THIS FLOOR IS CLOSED
DUE TO REMODELING

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.970
Save me...

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.070
Where are you?

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.360
Who are you?

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.700
Save me...

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.260
Is that you?

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.340
Save... me...

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.350
Homura...?

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.890
Get away from that thing.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.560
B-but... he's hurt!

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.030
No! Please, don't do something cruel!

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.570
This has nothing to do with you.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.950
But he was calling me!

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.330
I could hear him begging me to save him!

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.160
...I see.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.430
Madoka! This way!

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.840
Sayaka!

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.830
Now, of all times...!

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.000
Wh-what is with that girl?!

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.170
Now she's attacking people in cosplay?!

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.590
And what is that thing?

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.590
It's not a stuffed animal, is it? It's alive?

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.130
I don't know.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.260
I don't know what any of this
is. But we have to save him!

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.810
Huh?! Where'd the exit go?
What is this place?!

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:54.100
There's something wrong with this place.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.360
The path keeps changing!

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.280
What is going on here?!

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.410
There's something over there!

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.850
This has got to be a joke, right?

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.180
I mean, I must be dreaming, right?

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.190
Right?! Madoka?

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.080
H-huh?!

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.240
What is...?

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.950
That was close!

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.540
But you're safe now.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.420
Oh! You rescued Kyubey
for me, didn't you?

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.140
Thank you. He's a dear friend of mine.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.760
I-I was called to him.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.640
I heard his voice inside my head.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.770
Ahh, I see.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.020
Those uniforms...

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.690
You must be students at Mitakihara
Middle School too.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:21.690
Are you second-years?

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.150
Who are you?

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.610
That's right, I haven't introduced
myself yet.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.990
But before all that...

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.300
...mind if I wrap up a bit of work?

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.580
A-amazing...!

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.340
W-we're back...!

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.100
The witch escaped.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.730
If you want to finish it off, you'd
better go after it right now.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.650
I'll let you take it this time.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.060
I have business here.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.480
You don't read between the
lines very well, do you?

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.280
I'm telling you I'll overlook
what you did this time.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.540
Don't you think it would be better for both
of us not to court needless trouble?

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.820
Thank you, Mami!

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.150
You're a lifesaver.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.190
If you want to thank anyone,
it should be these two.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:30.280
I was just passing by.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.610
Thank you very much.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.200
My name is Kyubey.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.040
Were you the one who was calling me?

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.290
Yes, I was, Madoka Kaname.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.040
And you, Sayaka Miki.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.000
How do you know our names?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.590
I came here because I have
a request for you two.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.800
A... a request?

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.970
I want you to make contracts with
me and become magical girls!

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:00.270
“Soreja matane” tte te wo futte
I say “See you later” and wave my hand

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:04.900
Murini waratte samishiku natte...
I force myself to smile but I feel sad

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:20.160
Kousaten, shingou, tookuno kurakushon
Crossroads, traffic signals, horns from far away...

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:27.170
Shiranai darekano waraiau koe
And laughter of people I don't know

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:34.380
Kyou wa hitoride aruku kayoi nareta machi
When walking alone in the town where I’ve walked many times

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:44.940
Demo itsumo yori mo nanndaka jibun ga chotto chiisaku omoeruyo
But I feel that I am smaller than usual

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.980
“Soreja matane” tte te wo futte
I say “See you later” and wave my hand

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:55.240
Egao tsukutte samishiku natte...
I fake a smile and I feel sad

00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:01.700
Honto wa mada hanashi tarinai kedo
To be honest, I wanted to talk with you more

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.580
“Soreja matane” tte kotoba de
I would say “See you later”

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.960
Mata aerutte uso wo tsuite
I lied when I told you I'd see you again

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:16.340
Itsumo dourino egao de iuyo
I will tell you that with the usual smile on my face

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.720
“Mata ashita”
“See you tomorrow”

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.980
I will grant you one wish--any
wish you desire!

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.070
Huh? Really?!

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.230
What kind of wish?

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.690
Anything you want.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.030
I can grant you even the most
impossible of miracles!

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.200
EPISODE 2: THAT WOULD BE TRULY WONDERFUL

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.950
That would be truly wonderful.
