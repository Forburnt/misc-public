00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.920
Time-traveler, Homura Akemi...

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.880
By turning back time and
changing past events,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.210
you have traversed numerous
different timelines...

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.760
...and relived this past month over and
over, seeking the outcome you desire.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.930
Your existence has answered
at least one great mystery:

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.770
Why is Madoka Kaname's potential as
a magical girl so abnormally vast?

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.690
Now, at last, I have a theory
that explains it.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.860
You see, a magical girl's potential...

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.280
is based on the weight of the
karmic destiny she bears.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.490
I could've understood if she had been
the queen or savior of a country.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.790
But Madoka was only living an ordinary
life, so I couldn't understand why...

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.460
...so many threads of fate should all
be gathered so tightly around her.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.920
But now I think... Say, Homura...

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.050
Couldn't it be...

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.420
that Madoka has been made into
such a powerful magical girl...

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.220
because you kept turning back time?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.930
I thought so. You were the cause of it.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.360
Or to be more precise, a side effect
of your magic was the cause of it.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.520
What do you mean?

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.320
All this time reversal you did was
all for one purpose, wasn't it?

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.900
To save Madoka Kaname?

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.370
By turning back time over and over
for the same purpose and reason...

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.250
...you inadvertently caused multiple
timelines to converge together...

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.960
...and centered them all on the
existence of Madoka Kaname.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.210
If Madoka's threads of fate from each
of those separate timelines...

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.010
...all ended up linking to the Madoka
in this current timeline...

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.600
...it would explain why her magical
potential appears so impossibly huge.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.890
All that karmic destiny you set spinning
in all those different timelines...

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.520
...eventually attached to Madoka Kaname.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.520
After all, she was the main
culprit of every event.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.490
Excellent work, Homura.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.860
You've made Madoka into the most
powerful witch we've ever seen.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.620
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.910
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.830
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.630
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.730
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.860
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.700
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.780
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.910
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.830
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.130
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.470
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.890
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.190
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.610
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.730
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.450
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.780
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.370
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.370
EPISODE 11: THE ONLY THING I HAVE LEFT TO GUIDE ME

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.460
SAYAKA MIKI FUNERAL SERVICE

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.380
The body of Mitakihara Public Middle
School 2nd-year student,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.090
Sayaka Miki, who had been missing
since the 12th of this month,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.010
was discovered today in a room
at a downtown hotel.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.060
As there were no signs of violence
present at the scene of the crime,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.060
both murder and accidental death are
being considered by the police.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.610
Up next, the weather forecast.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.240
Tonight, expect moderate winds
from the northwest and rain.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.070
Welcome home.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.960
Hey, Madoka...

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
About Sayaka's case...

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.130
Are you sure you don't know
anything about it?

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.960
Yeah.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.810
Both Sayaka and Kyoko are dead...

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.900
It wasn't exactly an unexpected outcome.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.900
The signs had been there
for quite some time.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.780
So you're saying you don't care, then?

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.320
Even though you're somewhat
to blame for their deaths?

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.540
Then, for example, do you feel responsible
for the deaths of livestock?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.500
Do you ever think about the process by
which they become foodstuffs for you?

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.420
Stop it!

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.720
That's not a rational reaction.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.640
If you think these scenes are cruel,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.140
then you're missing the
big picture completely.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.350
Because they are slated to
become food for humans,

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.310
livestock are fed and provided
for all their lives...

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.860
...and given equal chance to reproduce
free from natural selection.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.150
Cows, pigs and even chickens...

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.610
have an overwhelmingly higher rate of
survival in captivity than in the wild.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.450
So isn't it actually...

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.990
a rather ideal, mutually beneficial
relationship for you both?

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.660
Are you saying it's the same
between you and us?

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.660
On the contrary,

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.580
our treatment of humankind...

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.420
is much more respectful than
your treatment of livestock.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.590
Perhaps it isn't perfect,

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.920
but we do acknowledge your species as
sentient and try to deal fairly with you.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.340
You can't believe that?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.720
Then shall I show it to you?

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.890
Shall I show you the history spent together
by mankind and Incubators?

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.570
We have intervened in your civilization's
development since prehistoric times.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.200
Countless girls throughout time have
made contracts with Incubators,

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.460
had their wishes granted...

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.420
...and then ultimately succumbed
to despair.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.050
Beginning in hope and then
ending in a curse...

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.130
...that is the cycle that countless magical
girls have repeated to this day.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.050
There are some who have wrought
revolutions that changed history...

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.810
...or elevated human society to
new stages of development.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.560
Please, stop!!

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.980
They all trusted you.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.730
They all trusted you, and
you betrayed them?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.490
It wasn't we who betrayed them,
but their own prayers that did.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.490
All hopes are wishes for something other
than the current reality, after all.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.290
And anything that doesn't match reality
is bound to create a distortion.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.080
So why is it surprising that these
things always end in disaster?

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.670
If they considered such a natural
outcome to be a "betrayal,"

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.050
they were wrong to have
made wishes at all.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.720
Not that I am calling them foolish.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.050
After all, it was thanks to their sacrifices...

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.220
that human society has
developed as far as it has.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.980
All the tears shed throughout history...

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.650
have laid the foundations
of the life you have now.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.910
If you understand now,

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.870
why are you still holding the fates of
a few individuals to be so precious?

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.750
After all the time you spent
watching over those girls...

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.170
do you really feel nothing for them at all?

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.420
Did you never try to understand
how much they were suffering?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.180
If we had the capacity to
comprehend such things,

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.390
we wouldn't have had to come to
your planet in the first place.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.930
In our society,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.850
the phenomenon known as "emotion"
is only considered a mental disease.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.400
That's why, when we discovered
humankind, we were quite surprised.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.480
We never imagined a world could exist...

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.400
in which every individual had
its own set of emotions...

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.490
...and still somehow managed
to coexist with others!

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.910
If you... had never come to Earth, then...

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.620
Most likely, you would all still
be living naked in caves.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.960
You know what...

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.970
...it really does hurt, losing one
of my own students this way...

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.680
Yeah...

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.850
We still don't even know what
really happened to her...

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.640
Now, I'm hearing that one of the third-year
students is missing as well...

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.810
Everyone was in an uproar
at the last staff meeting.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.060
No one knew anything, I'm guessing?

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.110
It seems that Sayaka was quarreling
with a friend over a boy.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.030
She's taking all of this pretty hard too.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.160
This kind of thing...

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.620
should've just passed with some
heartache and bittersweet memories.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.120
But since it ended this way...

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.460
The police are going to rule
it accidental death...

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.290
exacerbated by mental stress after
running away from home.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.630
They don't have any leads to go on.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.970
How is Madoka taking it?

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.720
I don't know.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.260
My gut tells me she knows
something about all this.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.390
But she doesn't seem like
she's lying to me either.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.650
This is the first time...

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.980
that I haven't been able to
tell what she's thinking.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.400
Pathetic, isn't it? She's my own daughter...

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.400
It's rare to see you so at
a loss over what to do...

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.910
Lately, something has seemed
a little off about her.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.870
I can tell something's weighing
on her mind,

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.460
but she hasn't come to talk
to me about it like usual.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.750
I thought she would always know
she could rely on me...

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.550
It's hard with kids that age...

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.840
You turn around one day, and
suddenly, they're all grown up.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.300
It must be a pretty big shock to a parent.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.720
I guess you're right...

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.270
At that point, we've got no
choice but to trust them.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.930
What Madoka probably
needs most right now...

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.310
is a little time to get a handle
on her feelings.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.060
Just give her some time.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.400
It's so hard not being able to do anything.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.450
You never were good at just sitting
by and waiting, were you, Junko?

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.080
HOMURA AKEMI

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.790
Can I come in?

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.090
Is that...

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.720
...Walpurgisnacht?

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.930
Kyoko told me about it.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.770
She said it was a witch so strong that
one person couldn't beat it alone,

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.230
so the two of you were teaming up.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.310
So you've been preparing for
that all this time here?

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.980
Will the city be in danger?

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.740
Unlike the other witches you've seen,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.830
this one is powerful enough that it doesn't
need to hide in a Labyrinth.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.330
If it manifests even once,
thousands will die.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.170
Since ordinary humans can't see it,

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:16.920
they'll think the destruction was caused by
an earthquake, tornado, or other disaster.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.630
Then it absolutely has
to be defeated, right?

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.390
Now that Kyoko's... dead too...

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.270
you're the only magical
girl left who can fight it.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:31.980
So maybe I--

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.100
I can do it on my own.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:39.400
While Kyoko Sakura couldn't have defeat
Walpurgisnacht on her own, I can.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.530
I actually never needed her help.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.070
I just agreed so that she
wouldn't lose face.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.370
...Honestly?

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.660
I don't know why, but...

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.880
...I really want to believe in you, Homura.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.670
I don't want to think that you'd lie to me.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.630
And yet, I just can't believe you're
really going to be all right.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.930
I just can't believe what
you're saying is true.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.680
How can I tell you what I’m really feeling?

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.730
Homura...?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.230
After all... I'm...

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.070
I'm not...

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.570
even living in the same time
that you are, Madoka!

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.010
You see, I... I come from the future.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.890
I've met you over and over,

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.150
and each and every time,
I've had to watch you die.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.320
What do I have to do to save you?

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.820
What do I have to do to change your fate?

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.950
Searching just for that answer,
I've kept redoing this month.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.700
What do--

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.160
I'm sorry... I'm not making
any sense, right?

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.370
I must seem horribly creepy, right?

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.170
After all, to you...

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.470
I'm just some transfer student you've
barely known for a month.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.180
But to me...

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.930
To me, you are...

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:38.900
The more times I redo all this, the further
in time we drift from one another.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.730
Our feelings drift further apart, and my
words don't even reach you anymore.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.240
The truth is, I think I've been
lost for a very long time now.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.620
Homura...

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.410
I will save you.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.160
That was the feeling that
I started all of this with.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:01.000
And now, it is the only thing
I have left to guide me.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.250
It's okay if you don't understand.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.970
It's okay if my words don't reach you.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.470
But, please...

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.970
Please... just let me protect you.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.640
HOMURA AKEMI

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.950
These thunderclouds are spreading and
rotating at unbelievable speeds.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.990
There's no doubt about it,
a supercell is forming!

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.500
Issue an evacuation order immediately!

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.500
Starting at 7AM this morning...

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.460
...an evacuation order is being issued
due to extreme weather conditions.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:48.010
All residents must immediately
evacuate to the nearest shelter.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.680
This is a public service announcement
for Mitakihara City.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.810
It's here.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.120
Are we going to camp tonight?

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.410
That's right!

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.290
Tonight, we're camping
here with everyone!

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.330
- Yay, camping! We barbeque?
- Homura...

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.590
This time...

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.100
...I'll put an end to you.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.420
What's wrong, Madoka?

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.170
Oh, I'm just going to the bathroom.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.890
Was Homura telling the truth about
being able to win by herself?

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.390
Even if I tell you no, would
you believe me anyway?

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.650
At this point, explanations are pointless.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.020
You should go and see for yourself.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.400
See how well Homura Akemi is
faring against Walpurgisnacht.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.950
Why does she push herself
that hard to fight?

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.790
Because she still hasn't given up hope.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:51.500
If things go badly, she'll probably just
negate this timeline and try again.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.840
She'll stubbornly continue her battle,

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.460
restarting this meaningless chain
of events over and over.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.340
Because at this point,

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.590
it is no longer possible for
her to stop or give up.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:13.230
The moment she acknowledges that
everything she has done is pointless,

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.150
and your fate is impossible to change,

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.150
Homura Akemi will fall into despair
and turn into a Grief Seed.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.990
She knows that as well.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.370
And that's why she has no choice.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.620
Whether she has any hope of winning or
not, Homura must continue to fight.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.830
So you're saying that as long as she
continues to hope, she can't be saved?

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.130
That's right.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.960
It's just as it was for all the other
magical girls in the past.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.470
Madoka, you saw it all as well, didn't you?

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.190
But...

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.100
But...!

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.560
But...!!

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.410
Where do you think you're going?

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.870
Mom?

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.950
I have to go to save a friend.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.450
Leave it to the firefighters.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.620
Civilians need to stay here.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.120
It has to be me!

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.460
You don't live your life just for
yourself, understand?!

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.590
Did you even think about how much
we would worry if you went off--

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:24.640
I know.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.800
I understand very well how you feel.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.730
Because I love you and dad that much too.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.810
So I understand how much
you both care about me...

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.900
...and I know that I need to take care
of myself for your sakes too.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.360
But this is different.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.570
It's because I treasure all of
you that I must protect you.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.830
To do that, there's someplace
I need to go right now!

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.210
And you can't tell me what this is about?

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.250
Then I'm going with you.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.300
No.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:06.090
You have to stay with dad and Tatsuya
and make sure they're safe.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:12.810
Mom, you told me you had raised me well.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.100
I don't tell lies. I don't do bad things.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.480
Will you believe in me now?

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.650
Will you trust that I'll do what's right?

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.160
Are you sure you're not making a mistake?

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.370
That you're not being misled
by anyone's lies?

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.370
Yes.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.500
Thank you, mom.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.860
If I let it get any further...

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.320
...the shelter will be attacked.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.490
Whatever happens, I have
to stop it right here!

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.080
No...!

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.930
Why...?

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.730
Why?! No matter how many times I try...

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.480
...why can't I win?

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.820
If I go back again...

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.280
I'll only make Madoka's destiny worse...

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.950
Then in the end...

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:55.660
Everything I've done...

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.780
That's enough.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.320
You've done enough, Homura.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:31.570
Madoka...

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.840
Madoka... You didn't...!

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.220
Homura... I'm sorry.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.480
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.240
Ai no hikari ga
You will turn on in your eyes

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.110
Toki wo koete
Someday will go beyond time

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:16.160
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.830
Tashika ni hitotsu kowasu darou
That is rushing towards destruction

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.620
Tamerai wo nomihoshite
What do you wish for

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.250
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:31.210
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:35.220
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.890
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.730
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:48.570
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:52.400
Hohoemu kimi ni aitai
And see you smiling

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.240
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.120
Taorareta hana no yuuki
Is the courage of a broken flower

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.960
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:15.630
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.190
If someone says it's wrong to have hope...

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:33.440
...then I'll tell them they're
wrong, every single time.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.780
And I know I'll always tell them so.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:40.120
FINAL EPISODE: MY VERY BEST FRIEND

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.370
My very best friend...
