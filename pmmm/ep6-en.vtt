WEBVTT

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.290
It's over!

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.560
Homura...?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.690
You!

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.570
Wha--

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.610
What the hell did you do?

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.780
Wha--

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.660
Oh, I see. You're that "irregularity",
aren't you?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.910
What the heck kind of
magic are you using?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.160
Stay out of our way!

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.670
Sayaka!

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.430
She's all right. She's only unconscious.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.470
Who the hell are you?

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.850
Whose side are you on, anyway?

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.100
I am on the side of those
who think rationally,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.140
and an enemy to those who
engage in needless conflict.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:05.890
Which are you...

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.650
...Kyoko Sakura?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.780
Have we met somewhere before?

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.490
Perhaps. Who knows?

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.170
Since I don't know anything about you...

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.880
Well, I'll be taking my leave for today.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.290
That's wise of you.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.300
You... saved us?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.810
How many times must I warn you?

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.270
How foolish can you possibly be?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.900
You should not become involved in this.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.650
I've told you many times already.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.490
But I...

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.700
If reasoning with a fool won't work, I
will turn to more drastic measures.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.460
Homura... Why...?

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.050
In any case, it's certain that
she's planning something.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.880
We'll have to be more careful than ever.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.180
Homura Akemi... Could it be that you're...?

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.640
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.940
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.850
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.650
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.750
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.880
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.720
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.800
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.930
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.860
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.150
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.490
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.910
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.210
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.630
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.760
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.470
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.810
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.400
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.390
EPISODE 6: THIS JUST CAN'T BE RIGHT

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.560
MIKI

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.820
There, you should be all right for a while.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.660
Ugh, it's pitch black!

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.620
And it's dangerous now.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.700
If it absorbs any more impurity,
a witch could hatch from it.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.790
Huh?!

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.540
Don't worry. Give it to me.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.180
Now it's safe again.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.220
You ate it?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.970
That's another one of my duties.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.190
But before it comes time to
purify your Soul Gem again,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.860
we'd better hurry and find
another Grief Seed.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.650
Is it that important to keep
my Soul Gem clean?

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.030
Kyoko Sakura was powerful, wasn't she?

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.530
If you have extra Grief Seeds
to clean your Soul Gem with,

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.160
you could let loose and waste as much
magic as you want in any fight.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.580
That's what makes Kyoko so strong.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.750
But I can't let innocent people get hurt
just so I can find more Grief Seeds!

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.550
The more you use your magic, the more
polluted your Soul Gem will become.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.720
Sakyaka, you'll never stand a
chance of defeating Kyoko...

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.810
unless you can gather more Grief Seeds.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.850
Hmm... You really think so?

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.610
But Mami never had enough Grief Seeds
to keep her Soul Gem clean either.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.740
But she was still able to fight just fine.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.700
Was she just more talented than me?

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.700
Well, there's certainly that.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.240
Aw, come on!

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.450
That's totally not fair!

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.710
That's one thing that really can't be helped.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.460
Kyoko has great inborn talent,
plus plenty of experience.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.880
That said, there's someone with
absolutely no experience...

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.590
...whose natural talent would
far exceed Kyoko's...

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.260
And who's that?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.970
Madoka Kaname.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.390
Madoka? Are you serious?

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.970
Yes.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.560
Meaning, if you ultimately can't get
strong enough to defeat Kyoko,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.900
you also have the option of
asking Madoka to do it.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.360
That is, if she makes a contract with me!

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.610
No, that's no good.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.110
This... is my fight, after all.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.990
I won't let her get dragged into it.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.290
CAUTION: NO FOOD OR DRINK ALLOWED.
NO SOLICITATIONS OR LOITERING.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.640
Yo! So what do you want now?

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.190
I want to put this city in your charge.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.610
And why the sudden change of heart?

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.400
Girls like you are most suited
to be magical girls.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.990
Sayaka Miki is not qualified.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.320
Hmph!

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.620
Well, that's what I was planning
from the start anyway.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.660
So what about that Sayaka girl?

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.700
If I leave her alone, she'll probably
come bug me again.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.460
I want that settled as peaceably
as possible.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.710
You keep out of it.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.080
I will handle her myself.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.210
You haven't told me the most
important thing, though.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.680
Who the heck are you?

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.930
What's in all of this for you?

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.940
Two weeks from now, "Walpurgisnacht"
will descend upon this city.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.690
How do you know that?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.900
That is a secret.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.320
In any case, if we are able to defeat it,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.320
I will leave this city, and you will be
free to do with it what you please.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.450
"Walpurgisnacht," huh?

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.540
Guess it would be pretty tough
to beat it by yourself.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.830
But if we double-teamed it,
we could probably win.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.050
Want some?

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.890
It's no use. Too much time has passed.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.150
It looks like we've got no way to trace
the familiar from last night.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.690
I see...

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.030
Hey... Sayaka?

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.360
If we keep hunting witches like this,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.820
won't we eventually run into that
girl from yesterday again?

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.790
Yeah... it seems pretty likely.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.370
In that case,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.790
maybe you should look for her ahead
of time and try talking with her first.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.550
Otherwise you might end up
fighting again like yesterday.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.340
"Fighting", you say?

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Is that what last night looked
like to you? "Fighting"?

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.690
That was an honest-to-goodness
fight to the death.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.230
It was only the first few blows
that weren't lethal.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.270
After that,

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.820
both she and I were sincerely trying to kill
each other with every blow we struck.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.280
But that's...!

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.860
That's even worse, then!

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.740
And you are telling me to talk with
her? That is completely insane!

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.120
She's willing to let people
become witch food...

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.700
...just so she can collect more Grief Seeds!

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.580
How could I ever be civil
with someone like that?!

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.670
Sayaka, you became a magical girl in
order to fight witches, didn't you?

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.720
That girl isn't a witch. She's
a magical girl just like you.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.560
If you give her a chance, I’m sure you'll
find a way to become friends.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.100
Even if your methods are different,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.680
you both feel the same way about wanting
to hunt witches, don’t you?

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.060
I'm sure she does...

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.770
...and Homura, too.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.940
I'm sure if Mami hadn't gotten into
a fight with her, she and Homura--

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.780
There's absolutely no way!

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.110
You saw her, didn't you, Madoka?!

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.490
She just waited...

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.040
...until that witch had murdered
Mami before she came to help.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.500
Just because she wanted a Grief Seed,
she sat back and let Mami get killed!

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.420
No... that's not--

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.920
That transfer student and that Kyoko
girl... they're both the same.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.760
They don't think about anything
but their own benefit!

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.890
I understand it now...

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.510
Mami was the one exception.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.770
All the rest of the magical girls
are just like those two!

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.560
N-no...

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.400
That familiar from last night
might've been small,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.940
but it could still kill someone.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.360
And who knows, maybe its next
target will be your dad or mom.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.200
It might even be little Tatsuya.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.070
Would you be okay with it then, Madoka?

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.830
Could you forgive those who stood
by and let them get killed?

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.620
I didn't wish for this power just
so I could fight witches.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.130
I wanted the strength to
protect those I love.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.790
Which is why...

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.800
If there are humans who are worse than
witches out there, I'll fight them too.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.760
Even if they happen to be magical girls!

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.510
Sayaka...

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.770
Kyubey, say something...

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.940
The only thing I could say to that
is that she's being too reckless.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.610
As she is now,

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.780
Sayaka has no hope of defeating either
Homura Akemi or Kyoko Sakura.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.610
But...

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.450
I'm sure Sayaka won't listen to me...

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.990
WELCOME HOME.
THERE'S SOME POTATO
SALAD IN THE FRIDGE.
-TOMO

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.410
Can't sleep?

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.080
No... Can we talk?

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.140
One of my friends... is in a lot of trouble.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.140
I don't think anything she's doing
or saying is wrong, but...

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.850
Even though she keeps trying so hard to
do the right thing, the more she tries,

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.400
the worse things get for her...

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.900
That happens quite a bit.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.030
It's sad to say,

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.990
but just because you keep
trying to do what's right...

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.530
doesn't mean you're guaranteed
a happy ending.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.120
In fact, sometimes people are so sure...

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.790
that their way is right that
they become obstinate.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.120
The more they get like that, the
further from happiness they go.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.130
But not ending up happy despite
not doing anything wrong...

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.750
That's awful.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.130
It is.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.130
What do you think I should do?

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.140
In a case like this,

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.180
no one else can bring about
a neat and tidy end to it.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.730
But would you still want to help resolve it,

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.150
even if it wasn't a neat and tidy resolution?

00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.900
Yes.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.650
Then you should make a mistake for her.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.200
Your friend is trying so hard to do right...

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.450
...that someone's got to make
some mistakes for her.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.330
Make mistakes...?

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.330
Sometimes you tell an awful lie, or
run away from something scary...

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.790
...and then later look back...

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.500
...and realize that that was actually
precisely the right thing to do, right?

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.670
If you can see there's no way for your
friend's problem to end but in disaster...

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.720
...it'd be better for her to crash and
burn sooner rather than later.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.220
But do you think she'll understand
that I'm doing it for her own good?

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.810
Sometimes they do, sometimes
they don't - especially at first.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.520
But I warned you it wouldn't
be a pretty ending.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.240
So what seems better to you?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.110
To give up on your friend, or to
be misunderstood by her?

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.830
Madoka... you've grown up
to be a very good girl.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.330
You don't tell lies or do bad things.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.170
You always try your best
to do the right thing.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.000
You've already passed your
childhood with flying colors.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.460
Which is why it may be good for you...

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.430
...before you become an adult
- to learn how to mess up, too.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.890
Learn how to mess up?

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.600
After all, wounds heal faster
when you're young.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.480
If you learn how to fall well now,
I'm sure it'll help you later in life.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.690
When you grow up, you see,

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.730
the consequences for messing
up get bigger and bigger.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.780
The more responsibilities
you start shouldering,

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.780
the more important it gets not
to make a wrong move.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.700
But isn't that... really painful?

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.330
Oh, us adults are always in pain.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.170
That's why we're allowed to drink alcohol!

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.670
I wish I could hurry up and drink
alcohol with you too, Mom.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.130
Then grow up super-fast, my dear.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.680
For adults, it's only as fun as it hurts!

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.110
Oh!

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.120
If you're looking for Mr. Kamijo,
he was discharged yesterday.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.040
He was doing so well with
his physical therapy...

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.000
...that they moved up his discharge date.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.790
O-oh, I see.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.240
Going home without even seeing him?

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.950
After you spent the whole day
running around chasing him?

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.160
You...

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.280
I know who you're after.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.290
The little rich boy who lives here, right?

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.460
The one you made the contract
with Kyubey for...?

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.120
Jeez!

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.040
You wasted your once-in-a-lifetime
miracle on something that stupid?

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.670
What would you know?!

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.220
Apparently, a lot more than you, dummy!

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:17.140
Magic is only supposed to be used
to grant wishes for yourself.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.600
If you use it for somebody else,
it always ends up going bad.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.440
Didn't Mami Tomoe even
teach you that much?

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.690
If all you wanted was to possess
the boy you love,

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.030
aren't there a lot of better ways to do it?

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.740
After all, you've got all that magic now...

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.490
What?

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.200
You should bust in there right now...

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.700
...and break his arms and legs so bad
he'll never be able to use them again.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.080
Make him so helpless he won't be
able to do anything without you.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.590
Do that, and this time, he really
will be yours and yours alone.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.130
Both his body and heart will be all yours...

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.470
If you don't have the guts to do it, I
wouldn't mind busting him up for you.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.350
You know, as a favor to
my fellow magical girl?

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.230
It'd be so easy to do, too...

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.400
No way...

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.980
You are the one person I'll never forgive!

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.650
This time, it ends!

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.610
Let's take this some place else.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.650
We're bound to attract attention here.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.830
Your friend is trying so hard to do right...

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.460
...that someone's got to make
some mistakes for her.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.670
But how could I ever...?

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.790
Madoka...

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.130
Madoka!

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.260
Hurry! Sayaka's in trouble!

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.760
Come with me!

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.020
We won't have to hold back up here.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.150
So gimme your best shot!

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.290
Wait! Sayaka!

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.000
Madoka...!

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.210
Don't get in my way! You
don't even belong here!

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.590
You can't do this! This just can't be right!

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.180
Hmph! Annoying jerks sure
attract annoying friends.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.180
Then what kind of friends would
you have, I wonder?

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.600
This isn't what we agreed on.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.940
I thought I told you to leave
Sayaka Miki alone.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.020
Well your way would've been too soft!

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.820
Besides, it's not like she's backing down...

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.030
I'll take her on, then. Stay out of it.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.530
You got until I finish eating this then.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.490
That's all I'll need.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.030
Don't underestimate me!

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.120
Sayaka!

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.290
I'm sorry!

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.470
Madoka! How could you...?!

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.300
Because if I hadn't--

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.220
Sayaka?

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.930
That wasn't good, Madoka...

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.770
No matter how mad you are,

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.360
you shouldn't throw your own
friend away like that.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:14.860
What?

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.860
What did you say?

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.280
No, stop!

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.280
What the heck is this?!

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.580
She's dead!

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.250
Sayaka?

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.840
Hey, Sayaka...?

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.880
Wake up! Hey!

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.470
Come on... What's wrong?

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.350
I don't want this... Sayaka...!

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.480
What the hell is going on here?

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.480
Hey!

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.480
It's because the furthest you magical
girls can control your bodies...

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.610
...would be within about
a 100 meter radius.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.740
100 meters? What are you talking about?

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.620
What do you mean?!

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.950
You rarely have this sort of accident...

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.080
...because you usually carry
it with you all the time...

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.710
What are you saying, Kyubey?!

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:14.960
You have to help her!

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.960
Don't let Sayaka die...!

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.670
Madoka, that isn't Sayaka.
It's just an empty shell.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:23.630
Huh?

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.390
Sayaka is what you just threw
away a moment ago.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.470
What... did you say?

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.850
Did you really think you
could fight witches...

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.400
...with the same fragile bodies
that humans possess?

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.400
It's unthinkable.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.110
For magical girls,

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.910
those so-called "bodies" that you possess
are really just exterior hardware.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.620
Your real bodies are your souls,

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.080
and in order to make them able
to use magic more efficiently,

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.710
we put them in these compact,
easy-to-protect forms instead.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.550
To complete the contract to
become a magical girl...

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.930
...what I do is rip your souls out of your
bodies and turn them into Soul Gems.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.010
Bastard... What have you done...?!

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.760
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.180
So now you've made us into
zombies or something?!

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.520
But isn't it handy this way?

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.690
Even if your body's heart gets crushed,

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.900
or you bleed out your very
last drop of blood...

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.490
...you can just heal your bodies with
magic and get right back up!

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.530
So long as your Soul Gem
remains unharmed...

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.030
...you're basically invincible!

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.000
Isn't that a lot better for battle than
those breakable human bodies?

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.920
That's horrible...

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.460
Too horrible for words...

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.760
You humans always react this way.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.680
Whenever I try to tell you the simple facts,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.550
you inevitably have this same reaction...

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.260
I just don't get it.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.350
Why are humans so touchy about
the placement of their souls?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.960
What?

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.510
What is it?

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.690
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.440
Ai no hikari ga
You will turn on in your eyes

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.310
Toki wo koete
Someday will go beyond time

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.360
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.030
Tashika ni hitotsu kowasu darou
That is rushing towards destruction

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.820
Tamerai wo nomihoshite
What do you wish for

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.450
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:01.420
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.420
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.090
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.930
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:18.770
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.600
Hohoemu kimi ni aitai
And see you smiling

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.440
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.320
Taorareta hana no yuuki
Is the courage of a broken flower

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.160
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:45.840
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.390
Before you took on this destiny
of battling witches,

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.140
wasn't there a wish you wanted granted?

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.940
That wish has really has
come true, hasn't it?

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:10.110
EPISODE 7: CAN YOU FACE YOUR TRUE FEELINGS?

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.030
That wish has really has
come true, hasn't it?
