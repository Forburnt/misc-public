WEBVTT

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.180
You tricked us, didn't you?

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.060
I told you precisely what
I wanted from the start:

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.850
For you to become magical girls.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.320
I just didn't explain exactly what
form you'd be taking to do that.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.900
Why didn't you ever tell us?!

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.860
Because you never asked.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.870
Even though you didn't know, there
wouldn't have been any inconvenience.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.410
In fact, even Mami never
noticed to the very end.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.340
After all, you humans don't physically
sense your souls to begin with.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.840
Actually, all they really are is
a little cluster of neurons.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.890
Just a nerve center with functions
similar to a circulatory organ.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.640
For all that, if they stop functioning,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.390
even your conscious minds seem
to crumble along with them.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.810
So to help prevent that,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.150
I put your souls in a form that's easier
to keep track of and protect.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.070
That makes it as safe as possible
for you to battle witches. Right?

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.030
Well, no one asked for your "help"
with something so ridiculous!

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.290
You still don't fully understand
what it is to do battle, do you?

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.040
For instance, say that you've
been impaled with a spear.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.170
How much pain do you think you could
take before you simply went into shock?

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.640
This is what real "pain" feels like.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.640
See? You could be totally incapacitated
with just one hit.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.990
You only managed to finish
the fight with Kyoko...

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.530
...because you were spared the
full extent of your body's pain.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.700
It was only possible because your mind
and body weren't directly connected.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.450
And as a result, you were able
to live through that fight.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.130
Once you get better at it,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.470
you can even detach yourself enough
to block out all sense of pain.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.840
That said...

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720
It causes your body to respond slower
when you command it to move,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.470
so I don't recommend it.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.140
Why...? Why would you do
such a thing to us...?!

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.350
Before you took on this destiny
of battling witches,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.480
wasn't there a wish you wanted granted?

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.480
That wish has really has
come true, hasn't it?

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.740
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.030
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.950
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.750
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.850
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.980
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.820
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.900
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.030
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.950
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.250
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.590
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.010
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.300
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.720
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.850
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.570
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.900
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.490
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.410
EPISODE 7: CAN YOU FACE YOUR TRUE FEELINGS?

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.290
Stand.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.750
Bow.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.400
Homura... Did you know?

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.070
Then why didnâ€™t you tell us?

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.990
I've tried telling others in the past.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.410
Not a single one has ever believed me.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.410
Why would Kyubey do something
so cruel to us?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.920
Because it doesn't think of it as cruel.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.670
It is a life form that cannot comprehend
human values.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.300
It would probably insist that it is simply
fair payment for the miracles it grants.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.550
But it's not a fair exchange at all!

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.510
To have that done to her body...

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.600
when all Sayaka wanted was to heal
the wounds of the boy she loved!

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.610
That doesn't change the fact
that it was a miracle.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.820
Because it made something
impossible possible.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.860
Even if Sayaka Miki had spent
her entire life caring for him,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.370
that boy never would have regained
the ability to perform.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.750
In truth, the value of a miracle is far
greater than that of an entire human life.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.580
And it is that which that creature sells.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.590
So Sayaka will never be able
to go back to her old life?

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.840
I told you once before, didn't I?

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.130
You should give up on Sayaka Miki.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.850
But Sayaka saved my life!

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.480
If she hadn't become a magical girl then,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.100
both Hitomi and I would have died!

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.150
Don't confuse gratitude with responsibility.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.990
You have no ability to save Sayaka Miki.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.910
If you hope to repay her in order to
alleviate your own sense of guilt, don't.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.490
There is no need for such presumption.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.420
Homura, why are you always so cold?

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.500
Perhaps...

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.420
...it is because I, too, am
no longer human...

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.510
Now that I've got a body like this...

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.720
...how can I possibly face Kyosuke again?

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.560
How long are you planning to sit
up there moping, blockhead?

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.160
Can you come out for a sec?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.070
I wanna talk.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.460
Guess you're really regretting it, huh?

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.210
This whole zombie thing...

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.680
As for me, I guess I'm okay with it.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.880
I mean, whatever the details,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.300
it was only after I got this power that
I was able to live like I wanted.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.720
So I guess it's not so bad that I'd regret it.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.270
It's all just "you get what you
pay for" to you, isn't it?

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.770
Exactly! "You get what you
pay for" - that's how I live.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.270
And if you live only to benefit yourself,

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.780
you've got to pay for your
own mistakes too.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.110
So I don't hold this against anyone,
and I don't regret anything.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.780
If you think like that, you can take most
anything without getting down.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.100
What did you bring me all
the way out here for?

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.730
It's gonna be kind of a long talk.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:07.480
Want one?

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.330
Don't ever waste food. I'll kill you if you do.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.520
See... this was my dad's church.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.530
He was an overly kind and earnest man.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.570
Like, the type who cries reading the
morning paper every morning...

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.160
and seriously thinks about
how to make things better.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.450
He thought that in order to
save a new generation,

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.910
we needed to have a new religion.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.080
That's what he always said.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.960
That's why, one day,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.460
he started preaching stuff that wasn't
in the Bible to his parishioners.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.010
Naturally, people stopped
coming to his sermons.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.430
Then he got excommunicated
by the church...

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.600
...and no one would listen
to his words anymore.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.430
I guess it was only natural, huh?

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.390
From the outside, he probably looked
like some raving cultist.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.520
No matter how right he was,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.900
no matter how logical the
things he said were,

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.230
the world only saw him
as some crazy outcast.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.280
It got to the point where our entire family
didn't even have food to eat.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.160
I just couldn't understand it.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.410
My dad wasn't saying anything
that was wrong.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.210
It was just different from what
people were used to hearing.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.420
If they would've given him just 5 minutes
to hear what he had to say,

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.130
anyone would've agreed that he was right.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.680
But no one would listen.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.850
I got angry.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.270
I couldn't accept it.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.940
I couldn't stand that nobody would
give my dad a chance...

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.480
...and understand what he was saying.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.570
So I asked Kyubey...

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.780
...to make everyone listen seriously
to what my dad said.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.910
The next morning, the church was
packed full of people again.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.170
Every day, they came in bigger and bigger
crowds to hear my dad speak.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.090
And as for me, I happily began
my work as a magical girl.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.260
After all, even if my dad was
preaching truth to the world,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.800
someone still had to take
care of the witches.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.010
And so...

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.520
...like an idiot, I thought of it as my role,
and threw myself into witch-hunting.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.810
I thought that my dad and me--

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.890
one from the front, one from the shadows--

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.150
were going to save this world together.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.820
But one day, my dad found out about me.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.950
When he heard that all the
people were there...

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.610
because I'd used magic
to make them come,

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.080
and not because they really
believed, he flipped out.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.040
He called me - his own daughter - a
witch who tainted people's hearts.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.040
Isn't that hilarious?

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.550
After I'd been out hunting
real witches every night!

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.430
After that, my dad had a breakdown.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.220
He was miserable in the end.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.930
He wasted away with drink, got
messed up in the head...

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.480
...then finally killed my whole family
and committed suicide.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.440
Leaving only me behind...

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.030
My wish destroyed my whole family.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.040
Because I went and made
a wish for someone else...

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.200
...without really knowing what he wanted,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.790
I ended up bringing everyone misfortune.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:59.300
Right then, I vowed in my heart never to
use magic to help anyone else again.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.800
I would use this power up...

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.050
...for my sake and mine alone.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.770
Miracles aren't free, you know.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:10.890
If you wish for hope,

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.020
an equal amount of despair will
be rained down upon you, too.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.730
That's how everything
stays in equilibrium...

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.980
...and the world's balance
doesn't get disturbed.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.990
Why are you telling me all of this?

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.030
'Cause you should just quit caring
and do whatever you want, too.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.740
"You get what you pay for," right?

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.910
Now, that's odd.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.250
Since you only live for your own benefit,

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.750
why are you worrying about
me, all of sudden?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.010
'Cause you started off with
the same mistake as me.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.510
You shouldn't keep living the kind of life
that's gonna bring you more regrets.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.020
I mean, you've already paid your dues
- and paid way too high a price.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:57.270
So now, you should just think about
how to get your money's worth.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:59.980
Like you do?

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.650
Yep.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.570
I've already figured out how
things really stand,

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.780
but you're continuing on
with the wrong idea.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.530
I couldn't watch you go on like that.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.000
I was really wrong about you.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I apologize for that, really.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.630
But even then, I don't regret making
my wish for someone else's sake.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.840
To make sure the feelings I made that
wish with never become a lie,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.930
I've decided I'll never regret anything. Ever.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.930
Why are you--

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.930
Actually,

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.430
I don't think I paid too high a price.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.440
Because, depending on how we use it, this
magic can be used for wonderful things.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.280
Which reminds me...

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.490
Those apples...

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.400
How did you get them?

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.740
Where did you get the money
to pay for them?

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.750
You can't answer me, can you?

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.790
In that case, I can't eat those apples.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.670
And I can't be happy about
receiving them either.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.420
You jerk!

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.880
We're magical girls!

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.430
There's no one else who
can do what we do!

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.550
I'll do things my own way...

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.180
...and continue my own fight.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.100
If that interferes with your life,

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.150
you're welcome to come
and try to kill me again.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.270
I won't lose to you.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.610
Nor will I resent you or anyone else.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.470
Sayaka! Good morning!

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.680
Good morning, Sayaka.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.310
H-hey!

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.310
Good morning!

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.110
Where were you yesterday?

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.530
Oh, I was just feeling a little sick...

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.070
Sayaka...

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.870
It's okay. I feel all right now.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:16.950
You don't have to worry.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.710
Well, then! Let's do our best today--

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.840
Oh!

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.130
Has Kamijo already been released
from the hospital?

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.140
Kamijo, are you really okay
to come to school already?

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.310
Yeah.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.440
If I just sat bundled up at home,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.900
it wouldn't help my leg
rehab much anyway.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.610
I'm aiming to walk without crutches
again by next week.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.360
I'm so glad for Kamijo.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.610
Yeah...

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.990
You should go say hi to him, Sayaka.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.370
You haven't talked to him yet, right?

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.410
I'm... fine here.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.050
So...

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.010
What did you want to talk about?

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.010
About love.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.850
I have a secret that I've been keeping
from both you and Madoka.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.440
Huh? Um, okay...

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.400
For a long time now, I...

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.320
...have been in love with Kyosuke Kamijo.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.030
O-oh, really?

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.920
I never would've guessed, Hitomi!

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.130
Kyosuke, the lucky guy--

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.880
Sayaka, you were a childhood friend
of Kamijo's, weren't you?

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:57.390
Y-yeah, or, um, maybe more of
a tag-along or something...

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.390
Was it really only that?

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.730
I've decided not to lie to myself any longer.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.440
How about you?

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:12.900
Sayaka, can you face your true feelings?

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.530
W-what are you talking about?

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.160
You are a precious friend to me.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.080
That's why I don't want to cut in
or steal him out of your hands.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:30.040
The amount of time you spend looking
at him surpasses even mine.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.090
So I think you have the right
to try for him before me.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.050
Hitomi...

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.100
I will confess my love to Kamijo
after school tomorrow.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.100
I will wait one full day for you.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.850
So please decide what to do so
you won't have regrets, Sayaka.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.520
Decide whether you want to confess
your feelings to Kamijo, or not...

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.820
I-I...

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.930
Madoka...

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.010
Is it okay if I come along?

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:28.690
I don't want you to be all alone,
Sayaka. So please...

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.810
You... Why...?

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.320
Why are you so nice?

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.900
I don't deserve such kindness...

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.160
What?

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.910
I had a moment today, where
I almost regretted something.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.830
For just a split-second, I thought,

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.250
"If only I hadn't saved Hitomi that time..."

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.420
I completely fail at being an ally of justice.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.340
How will I ever face Mami?

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.480
I'm going to lose Kyosuke to Hitomi...!

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.360
And there's nothing I can do...

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.030
Because I'm already dead...

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.780
Because I'm a zombie...!

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.160
I can't ask him to hold me when
I have a body like this!

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.240
I can't ever ask him to kiss me!

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.390
Thank you...

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.760
I'm sorry.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.010
Sayaka...

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.850
I'm okay now.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.810
I got it all out.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.480
Now, let's go.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.820
We've got some more witches
to beat up today!

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.530
Okay.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.340
It's not like you to just
sit quietly and watch.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.050
She's battling a witch today, not a familiar.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.470
It's sure to drop a Grief Seed.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.140
So it isn't a waste this time.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.600
But I'm surprised that you're handing
over your prey for such a reason.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.190
That idiot! How long does
it take her to finish it!?

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.270
Sayaka!

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.490
For Pete's sake! I just can't watch this!

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.990
Just get back for now.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.750
I'll show you how it's done!

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960
Hey!

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.540
Stay out of my way. I can do this alone!

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.590
Sayaka!

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.680
You... you're not...?

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.990
It's really true!

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.780
If I just detach myself...

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.750
...I really donâ€™t feel any pain!

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.710
Stop...

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.840
Please, just stop...

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.730
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.480
Ai no hikari ga
You will turn on in your eyes

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.360
Toki wo koete
Someday will go beyond time

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.400
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.070
Tashika ni hitotsu kowasu darou
That is rushing towards destruction

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.870
Tamerai wo nomihoshite
What do you wish for

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.500
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.460
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.460
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.130
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.970
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.810
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.650
Hohoemu kimi ni aitai
And see you smiling

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.480
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.360
Taorareta hana no yuuki
Is the courage of a broken flower

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:34.200
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:45.880
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.310
I'm going to be a different kind
of magical girl from all of you...

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.180
That's what I've decided...

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.940
I don't need thanks or recompense.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.690
I'll be the one magical girl who won't
use her magic for herself.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.070
EPISODE 8: I WAS STUPID... SO STUPID

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.740
I was stupid... so stupid.
