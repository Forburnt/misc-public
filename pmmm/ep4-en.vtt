00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.020
Oh, are you here to see Kamijo?

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.850
Y-yes.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.230
I'm sorry.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.570
His examination schedule got moved up,
so he's in Physical Therapy right now.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690
Oh, I see.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.860
Thank you.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.530
She comes to see him quite
often, doesn't she?

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.830
It's a big help.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.540
He's a difficult case, that boy.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.540
I really hope she'll become the
encouragement he needs to get better.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.550
Before the accident, he was a child
prodigy, wasn't he? On the violin?

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.260
Even if he's able to walk
again, his fingers...

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.390
...will probably never recover
enough to play again...

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850
Why did it have to be Kyosuke?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.820
My fingers work perfectly,
but what good are they?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.320
Why couldn't it have been
me instead of Kyosuke?

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.540
If I were to use my wish to heal his body...

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.790
...what would Kyosuke think about that?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.840
Would he just say, "thank you" and
that would be the end of it?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.010
Or am I hoping he'll say something more?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.640
I'm...

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.720
...such a horrible person...

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.060
Now that I think about it, I really didn't
understand anything back then.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.980
Neither what it meant
to pray for a miracle...

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.560
...nor the price of one.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.440
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.740
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.660
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.450
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.550
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.680
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.520
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.610
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.730
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.660
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.950
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.290
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.720
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.010
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.430
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.560
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.270
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.610
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.200
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.200
EPISODE 4: MIRACLES AND MAGIC ARE REAL

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.090
Madoka!

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.890
If you don't hurry and eat,
you'll be late for school.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.180
Oh... right...

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.610
Sis, wat's wong?

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.610
D-does it taste bad, honey?

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.830
No... It tastes good.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.080
Really, really good...

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.380
I'm alive... And your cooking...
tastes so good, Dad...

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.630
So I was like, "Jeez, Yuka!"

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.260
"You still donâ€™t get it even after all that?!"

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.380
And she was like,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.640
"Huh? Did I say something weird
again?" and got all weepy.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.720
I wanted to laugh so bad!

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.770
Sayaka... About yesterday...

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.230
Sorry, but can we talk about it later?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.740
While a woman's prime age for childbirth
is indeed based in medical fact...

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.990
...counting backwards from there...

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.040
...to determine whether she
is of a marriageable age...

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.960
...is an extremely grave mistake!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.790
In other words...

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.790
...of course women over the age of 30...

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.750
...still have a chance of marrying
for love. Therefore...

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.010
...we would use the present progressive
tense here instead of the past perfect--

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.320
It... feels like we're in a foreign
country or something.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.820
Even though nothing about school or
Hitomi has changed since yesterday...

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.120
Somehow, it feels like I'm surrounded
by strangers...

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.660
It's because no one knows.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.670
No one knows about witches... or Mami...

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.130
It's because we know,
and no one else does.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.180
It's like we're seeing and living in an
entirely different world from them.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.600
Sayaka?

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.520
But our world had already
changed long before this.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.520
We should have realized that sooner.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.950
Madoka, do you still want to
be a magical girl, even now?

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.290
Yeah, I know.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.830
Well, I can't blame you.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.790
I know it's unfair...

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.170
I know it's way too selfish of
me to back out now, but...

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.260
But I just can't.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.680
Just thinking about the way she died...

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.140
Even now, it gets so hard to breathe...

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.980
I'm scared... I don't want that...!

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.320
Mami was truly a kind-hearted person.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.490
To make us really understand...

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.450
...what kind of resolve we'd
need in order to fight, she...

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.210
Hey, Kyubey... What's going
to happen to this town?

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:07.420
Who's going to fight to protect everyone
from the witches from now on?

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.840
This town has been Mami's
territory for a long time.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.510
But once the other magical girls realize
she's gone, they won't stay back for long.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.520
I'm sure one of them will arrive
here soon to hunt witches.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.390
But all they care about are
finding Grief Seeds, right?

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.020
Just like that transfer student.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.570
It's true that magical girls
like Mami are rare.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.400
Most do approach witch-hunting
with their own benefit in mind.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.360
But it's natural for people to want
to be rewarded for their work.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.410
Then--

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.870
But I think the only ones who have
a right to judge their actions...

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.750
...are their fellow magical girls, who
bear the same destiny they do.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.210
All right, I understand.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.340
It really is an awful shame, but
I can't force you, after all.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.550
I guess this is good-bye then.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.720
I'd better go search for girls with greater
need to make a contract with me.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.060
I'm sorry, Kyubey.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.770
No, I should apologize for getting
you mixed up in all this.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.730
Though we weren't together for long,
thank you, Madoka. It was fun.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.740
I'm sorry...

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.160
MAMI TOMOE

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.410
I'm sorry.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.330
For being so weak...

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.160
I'm sorry...

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.300
Homura...

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.190
You're blaming yourself too much
for this, Madoka Kaname.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.350
Huh?

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.900
No one could criticize you
for anything you've done.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.820
And even if they did, I wouldn't permit it.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.910
It seems you've taken my warning to heart.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.330
Yeah...

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.920
If I had only listened to you earlier...

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.340
It wouldn't have changed
Mami Tomoe's fate.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.550
But I was able to change yours.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.510
I'm glad I was able to save
at least one person.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.310
S-say, Homura...

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.320
You seem like you're a veteran too. Though
in a different way from Mami...

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.530
Perhaps. I won't deny it, at least.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:24.330
Have you seen a lot of people
die like yesterday?

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.750
Yes.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.670
How many?

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.880
Too many to try keeping count of anymore.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.510
I wonder if Mami's apartment
will just stay like that.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.140
Mami Tomoe had no close relations.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.940
It will be a long time before a missing
person's report will even be filed for her.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.060
Then, no one will even know
that Mami is dead?

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.900
It can't be helped.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.280
If someone dies on the other side,
there won't be a body left behind.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.910
In this world, she will simply remain
a missing person forever.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.950
That is the end that all magical girls meet.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.050
That's horrible!

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.390
She fought to protect everyone
for so long on her own!

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.400
To think that no one will even
realize she's dead...

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.940
...that's just too sad!

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.700
That is the nature of the contract
that grants us the power we hold.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.320
And we don't fight to protect people.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.580
We fight for the sake of our own wishes.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.000
If our deaths go unnoticed by others...

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and we are ultimately forgotten
by this world...

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.460
I suppose that cannot be helped.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.920
I won't forget...

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.970
I'll never forget about Mami!

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.760
Never!

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.850
I see.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.730
I'm sure with that alone, Mami
Tomoe must truly be happy.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:13.980
I envy her.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.360
You too, Homura!

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.360
You too--

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.980
I swear I'll never forget you either!

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.360
I'll never forget...

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.650
...the way you saved us yesterday!

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.200
Homura...?

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.540
You're too kind for your own good.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.370
Huh?

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.290
Remember this...

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:39.420
That kindness may bring about
an even greater tragedy.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.900
What are you listening to?

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.660
"The Girl With the Flaxen Hair."

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.780
Ah, by Debussy, right?

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.410
It's such a beautiful song!

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:22.210
I-I guess I don't strike people as the type
who would listen to classical music.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.970
Sometimes, people get so surprised
when I can name a piece like that.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.430
I guess it's so unexpected, people
sometimes get impressed with me.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.640
It's only because you taught
me about all this.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.810
If not for you, I may never have given
classical music a real chance.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.940
Maybe not for my whole life, even.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.610
Hey, Sayaka...

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.700
What is it?

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.200
Are you torturing me?

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.830
Why are you still making
me listen to music?

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.460
Are you trying to cause me more pain?

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.420
But I thought you loved music, Kyosuke...

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.510
I don't want to hear it anymore!

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.380
I don't want to hear these songs
that I can't ever play again--

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.260
That I can only ever listen to anymore!

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.470
I just... I just...

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.230
I can't move it...

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.490
I can't even feel the pain anymore!

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.910
What use is a hand like this...?

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.280
It's going to be okay.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.990
I'm sure someday, somehow...

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.620
Just don't give up hope,
and I'm sure someday--

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.370
But they've already told me to give up.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.380
They said I had no chance
of ever performing again.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.170
The doctor came and told me himself.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.380
He said that with current medicine,
it just wasn't possible.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.930
My hand will never move again.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.680
Not until the day miracles or magic
start existing in this world.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.810
They do exist.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:02.020
Miracles... and magic... are real!

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.660
Homura...

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.750
When I actually tried talking with her, it
seemed like we could really be friends.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.960
So why did she end up fighting with Mami?

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.590
Huh?

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.050
Hitomi?

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.550
Hitomi!

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.380
Don't you have your lessons to--

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.930
Huh? It's the same as that woman's--

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.730
Hitomi!

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.940
Hey! Hitomi, come on!

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.900
Ah, Kaname! Good evening.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.110
What's happened to you?

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.490
Where are you going?

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.070
Where am I going, you ask?

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.530
I'm going somewhere
far better than here...

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.410
Hitomi...

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.290
Oh, yes. You simply must come along!

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.380
Yes, indeed. It would be so wonderful!

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.130
What should I do?

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.220
This couldn't be...?

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.230
If only I could contact Homura...

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.240
Oh, but I don't have her cell phone number!

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.990
It's true... I'm completely... worthless...

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.040
I couldn't even keep such
a tiny factory running...

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.000
In an era like this one...

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.260
...there's just no place
for someone like me...

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.390
Listen closely, Madoka.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.900
Don't ever mistake this one for the
other, or the results could be fatal.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.440
Our entire family could end up dead.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.650
Make sure you never mix up these bottles.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:15.860
Stop!

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.110
You can't use those!

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.200
You mustn't interfere.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.200
This is a sacred ceremony.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.710
But those chemicals! They're dangerous!

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.330
Everyone here will die!

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:29.590
That's right.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.760
All of us are going to journey to a
magnificent new world together.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.470
Don't you see how wonderful that will be?

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.100
These physical bodies would
simply get in our way.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.270
Kaname, I'm sure you'll
understand very soon...

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.320
Let go of me!

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.150
W-what should I do?! What should I do?!

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.160
No!! No...

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.290
This can't...

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.090
No! Someone help me!

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.710
I wonder if this...

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.920
...is my punishment.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.550
For being...

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.300
...a coward...

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.670
...and a liar.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.380
I guess this...

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.390
...is a fitting punishment.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.120
Sayaka?!

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.550
This is the end for you!!

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.280
Hey, sorry about that!

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.610
I cut it pretty darn close, didn't I?

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.990
Sayaka...

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.280
Those clothes...

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.160
Huh? Oh...

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.080
Uh, well. Guess I had a change of heart.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.920
Oh, I'll be fine!

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.630
After all, I did pretty well for
my first time out, didn't I?

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.260
But...

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.010
You...

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.230
Aren't you pretty late, Transfer Student?

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.300
I didnâ€™t think you would come...

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.010
I heard ol' Mami had bought it.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.810
So I came all this way.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.520
But what's the deal?!

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.560
Sure looks like the story's changed
from what you told me.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.230
Sorry, but this territory has already been
taken over by another magical girl.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.400
Though she only just made the
contract a short while ago.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.570
What?!

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.690
That really pisses me off!

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.450
But y'know...

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.990
I find the idea...

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.530
...of handing such prime territory
over to some rookie hatchling...

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.370
...to be pretty annoying.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.750
What do you intend to do, Kyoko?

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.210
There's only one thing to do.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.460
I'll put the new girl out of commission.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.050
Permanently.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.440
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.190
Ai no hikari ga
You will turn on in your eyes

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.060
Toki wo koete
Someday will go beyond time

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.110
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.780
Tashika ni hitotsu kowasu darou
That is rushing towards destruction

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.570
Tamerai wo nomihoshite
What do you wish for

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:56.200
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.170
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:05.170
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.840
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.680
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.520
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.350
Hohoemu kimi ni aitai
And see you smiling

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.190
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:30.070
Taorareta hana no yuuki
Is the courage of a broken flower

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:33.910
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:45.590
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.060
I'm really getting fired up for this now.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.650
From here on, I - Magical Girl Sayaka -

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.360
will keep Mitakihara City super-duper
safe and sound!

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.860
EPISODE 5: THERE'S NO WAY I'LL EVER REGRET IT

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.530
There's no way I'll ever regret it.
