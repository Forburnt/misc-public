WEBVTT

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.470
Hi...

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.440
Here. For you.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.740
Really, thank you so much for all of this.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.700
You're really some kind genius
at finding rare CDs, aren't you?

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.950
Nah!

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.620
I just get lucky, that's all.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.870
This soloist's interpretations
are really incredible.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.160
Do you want to try listening
to it too, Sayaka?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.080
I-if you don't mind...

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.000
I wish I could play this on a speaker for
you, but we are in a hospital, after all...

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.630
Kawashita yakusoku wasurenai yo
I won't forget our promise we made

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.920
Me wo toji tashikameru
I close my eyes to make sure

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.840
Oshiyoseta yami
I will move forward,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.630
Furiharatte susumuyo
shaking off the surging darkness

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.730
Itsuni nattara nakushita mirai wo
When can I see the future that I lost

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.860
Watashi kokode mata mirukoto dekiruno?
Here in this place once again?

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.700
Afuredashita fuan no kage wo
Tearing up the shadow of anxiety

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.790
Nando demo saite
That floods into me many times

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.920
Kono sekai ayunde ikou
I will keep walking in this world

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.840
Tomedonaku kizamareta
Time that is endlessly ticking

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.140
Toki wa ima hajimari tsuge
now starts

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.470
Kawaranai omoi wo nose
With our everlasting passion,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.900
Tozasareta tobira akeyou
And open the door that has been closed

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.190
Mezameta kokoro wa hashiridashita
Our awakened souls

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.610
Mirai wo egaku tame
Set out to paint our rising future

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.740
Muzukashii michi de tachi domattemo
Even if we get stuck on a troubled path

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.450
Sora wa kireina aosa de itsumo mattete kureru
The beautiful blue sky always waits for us

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.790
Dakara kowaku nai
So I won't be afraid of anything

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.380
Mou naniga attemo kujikenai
Whatever happens, I won't give up

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.380
EPISODE 3: I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING ANYMORE

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.890
Tiro Finale!!

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.440
Maaan, you are so cool, Mami!

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.150
This isn't a magic show, you know.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.200
Don't forget that what we're doing
here is very dangerous.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.120
Right on!

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.000
It didn't drop a Grief Seed this time.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.880
It's because that was only a witch's
familiar - not a witch itself.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.880
Familiars don't carry Grief Seeds.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.590
So that wasn’t a witch...

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.920
It seems like we've only been
fighting duds lately.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.090
Yes, but we can't leave familiars
to do as they please.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.600
If allowed to develop,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.180
familiars become the same kind
of witch they broke off from.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.560
Well, shall we go?

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.520
So have you figured out what to wish for?

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.150
Nah... How about you, Madoka?

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.440
Uh-uh...

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.820
That's how it goes, once someone tells
you to think hard about something.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.910
What did you wish for, Mami?

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.750
Oh! I don't mean to pry if you
don't want to answer--

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.830
In my case...

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.800
...I didn't have the luxury
of thinking about it first.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.850
It's not that I have any regrets.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.140
I think the life I currently live...

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.360
...is far better than dying in that
place would have been.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.020
But...

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.780
I'd like those who do have the chance
to think carefully before deciding.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.240
I want them to have the
choice I didn't have.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.700
Hey, Mami...

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.290
If you make a wish, does it
have to be for yourself?

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.910
Huh?

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.460
For example - and this is really
just an example, okay?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.130
Say there was someone who was having
a way tougher time than I am,

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.630
and I wanted to make my wish to help him.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.380
Are you talking about Kamijo?

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.470
I said this was just an example!!

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.980
There's no requirement that the wish's
beneficiary be the contractee herself.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.890
There's even precedent for it already.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.020
But it may not be the best idea.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.070
If you want to use your wish
to grant someone else's,

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.360
then you must make doubly sure you
know what you're wishing for.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.070
Miki, do you truly wish for
his dream to come true?

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.870
Or do you actually wish to grant his dream
so that he will be grateful to you?

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.290
Mami...!

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.500
They sound similar, but they're completely
different at the core.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.330
You know?

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.420
...That's a little harsh, isn't it?

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.630
I'm sorry.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.010
But this really needs to be said
now, before it's too late.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.260
Because if you go ahead with
it without making certain first,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.430
you're sure to regret it later.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.600
...You're right.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.310
I guess my idea was a little naïve.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.060
Sorry.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.150
It really is a hard decision, isn't it?

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.860
There's no need to rush into it.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.950
Though for me, the sooner
you decide, the better.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.160
That's no good, Kyubey.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.040
Nobody likes a boy who pressures
girls to do things.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.630
It really isn't an easy decision, is it?

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.550
And considering my position, I can't
rush you into deciding either.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.880
Suggesting wishes would
also be against the rules.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.140
So I guess just wishing to become
a magical girl wouldn't work, huh?

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.680
Is power for its own sake what
you desire, Madoka?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.060
It isn't that.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.770
...Or... Maybe it IS that...

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.400
I mean, I'm not very smart, and
I don’t really have any talents.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.700
So if I could become someone as
cool and wonderful as Mami...

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.410
...I'd be more than happy with just that.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.490
If you became a magical girl, Madoka,

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.660
you'd be much more powerful than Mami.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.410
Huh?

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.250
Though, of course, part of that depends
on what kind of wish you make.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.220
Even I can't completely gauge how large
the Soul Gem you'd create would be.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.680
I've never met another girl with such
enormous potential as you.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.220
Oh, come on!

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.310
You're just teasing me, right?

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.180
No...

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.020
Madoka? Are you awake?

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.940
Yes. What's wrong?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.530
Oh, not again.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.990
Oh, Mom...

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.120
W-water...

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.540
...that balding old coot...!

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.750
If he wants a drink so badly, he can
damn well pour it himself...!

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.710
Thanks.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.880
Shall I make us some hot chocolate?

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.510
Yes, please!

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.140
I wonder why she loves to work so much.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.270
I mean, it wasn't always her dream
to work for that company, was it?

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.430
Hmm...

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.020
It isn't so much that Mom
enjoys her work...

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.770
What she really likes is trying
her best at something.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.110
Even though she encounters lots
of trying and unpleasant things...

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.950
...the satisfaction she gets from
overcoming those challenges...

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.450
...is what she treasures most in this world.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.200
So even though working at a company
wasn't necessarily her dream...

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.920
...the way she is living her life
is absolutely ideal to her.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.630
It's possible to achieve your dreams
in that way as well, you know.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.420
So the way she lives her
life was her dream?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.970
Different people might have
different opinions of that...

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.390
But as for me, that's something
I really love about her.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.640
I respect the way she leads her
life and am very proud of her.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.520
She truly is amazing, isn't she?

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.600
Yeah.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.160
You do understand, don’t you?

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.410
That you're leading innocent
bystanders into real danger?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.670
They were chosen by Kyubey.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.340
They're not innocent
bystanders anymore.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.340
You're trying to lead them so that
they want to be magical girls.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.050
And you don't like that, I take it?

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.640
No. It's a problem.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.890
...Particularly in the case
of Madoka Kaname.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.980
I see. So you've noticed
it as well, have you?

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.890
That she has incredible potential.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.270
She is the one person I absolutely cannot
allow to make the contract.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.820
Afraid that a magical girl stronger
than you will get in your way?

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.700
That's the way a bullied child thinks.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.830
I have no wish to fight you, but...

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.620
Then take care to ensure that our
paths will never cross again.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.370
Tonight will probably be the last time...

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.040
...that we will be able to speak
without coming to blows.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.560
Hey. Sorry for the wait.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.350
Huh? Weren't you able
to see Kamijo today?

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.400
Apparently, he couldn't be inconvenienced
to see me today or something.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.110
Seriously, after I took all the trouble
to come here. How rude!

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.910
What's wrong?

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.910
There's... something over there.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.790
A Grief Seed!

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.620
It's about to hatch!

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.170
No way! Why here of all places...?

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.130
This isn't good. We have to get out of here!

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.840
A Labyrinth is about to open up here!

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.130
You mean one of those crazy mazes?!

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.300
Madoka, do you have Mami's
phone number on you?

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.760
N-no...

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.260
This isn't good...

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.680
Madoka, find Mami and bring her here.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.270
I'll stay here and keep an eye on that thing.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.650
No!

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.810
That's too dangerous.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.110
Though there's still time before
the witch emerges,

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.940
once the labyrinth pulls you inside,
you won't be able to leave it.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.700
There's no guarantee that Mami
will get here in time to save you.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.660
But once the labyrinth opens, we'll
lose track of the witch, won't we?

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.960
I can't afford to let that happen. Not here...

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.170
Madoka, you go on ahead.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.300
I'll stay here with Sayaka.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.300
Huh?

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.220
Once Mami gets here, she'll be able
to track my position using telepathy.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.140
So if I stay and watch the
Grief Seed with Sayaka,

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.390
I'll be able to guide Mami...

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.140
...down the shortest path to us.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.140
Thank you, Kyubey!

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.610
Then, I'll find Mami and bring
her here as fast as I can!

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.670
Are you frightened, Sayaka?

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.220
Well, yeah... that kind of
goes without saying.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.010
If you were just to decide upon a wish...

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.770
...I could turn you into a magical
girl right here and now.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.890
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.730
Right.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.940
If things get bad enough,
I may ask you to do that.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.730
But I'll hold off for now.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.570
Because this is such an important
decision to me...

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.780
...I don't want to make it rashly if possible.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.830
Here, right?

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.710
Kyubey, what's the situation?

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.300
We're still okay.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.590
It looks like the witch isn't
going to hatch just yet.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.340
Sayaka, are you okay?

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.680
Totally fine.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.010
I'm so bored I'm about to doze off in here!

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.260
Right now,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.060
it'd be better not to use any large amounts
of magic that might disturb the egg.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.350
There's no need to hurry,

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.400
so come to us as quietly as you can.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.480
Got it.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.910
Thank goodness we made it in time.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.000
Though Sayaka took such a huge
risk that I'm actually a bit angry...

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.340
But in this one case, it was a good,
clear-headed call on her part.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.130
This way, we won't have to worry
about the witch getting a--

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.800
I thought I told you I didn't
want to see you again.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.180
I shall hunt this prey.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.890
The two of you should leave here.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.770
I don't think so.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.480
Miki and Kyubey are waiting
for us in there.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.730
I shall guarantee their safety.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.980
And you think we could trust you?

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.780
F-fool!

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.320
This isn't the time for--

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.370
I don't want to hurt you, of course.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.750
But if you insist on struggling,
the cords will only tighten.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.670
This witch is not like the others!

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.300
Behave and I will release you unharmed
after I finish up here.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.840
Let's go, Kaname.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.220
O-okay.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.430
Wai--!

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.250
Um... Mami?

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.620
What is it?

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:45.250
I've been thinking really hard about
all sorts of different wishes, but...

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.460
Did you decide on one?

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.340
Yes.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:54.260
But, I think it might be the naïve kind
of wish that would make you mad...

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.430
So what is this dream you want granted?

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.270
Well, I've never been good at school,

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.690
and I don’t have any kind of talent
that I could take pride in...

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.980
And I'm sure I'll continue on like this,

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.530
being no use to anyone and having
to bother others for help...

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.700
Thinking about that makes me
feel so awful, I can't stand it.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.290
But then I met you, Mami.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.830
And you showed me what it's like...

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.090
...to fight to save people.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.670
And then...

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.550
...when I heard that even I might
be able to do the same thing...

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.930
...it was the happiest thing I'd
ever experienced in my life.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:40.810
That's why, I think that just becoming
a magical girl would fulfill my dreams.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:47.150
If someone like me can help people
and live my life with pride...

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.280
That would be my greatest dream.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.240
It won't be easy, you know?

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.120
You'll get injured,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.160
and you won't have time to go on
dates or have fun with friends.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.500
Even so, after watching the way
you keep doing your very best...

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.580
...I really look up to you, Mami.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.540
I'm really not worth looking up to.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:08.670
Huh?

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.170
I only push myself and pretend to be cool.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.760
Even when I'm scared, or hurting,
there's no one I can talk to.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.050
All I can do is cry on my own.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.520
It isn't a good thing...

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.060
to be a magical girl.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.020
But you're not alone any more, Mami.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.070
You're right...

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.440
I'm not alone anymore, am I?

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:39.370
Will you really stand and fight
with me from now on?

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.290
Will you really stay with me?

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.500
Yes. If someone like me will do.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.920
Oh, goodness!

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.630
Some role model I'm supposed to be.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.050
I'm really no good at this, am I?

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.550
Mami...

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.640
Still, it's not every day you
can have a wish granted.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.180
So try to think of something you want.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.230
Yeah, it is a special chance, isn't it?

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.690
You're still making a contract, after all,

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.110
so you may as well get something out of it.

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.860
You could wish to become a billionaire,
or maybe to have a perfect boyfriend.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.780
Anything you want.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.070
Um, but...

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.360
Okay, then how about this?

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.160
If you can't decide on a wish by
the time I finish off this witch...

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.660
...we'll ask Kyubey to give us a huge
feast with a fabulous cake!

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.080
C-cake?!

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.370
Yep!

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:30.540
The biggest and most
extravagant cake ever!

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.920
And with it, we'll have a
big party for everyone--

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.800
To celebrate the two of us becoming
a magical girl duo!

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.390
But I can't become a magical
girl for a cake!

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.930
No? Then decide on a wish
you really do want.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:45.890
Mami!

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.770
The Grief Seed's moving!

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.900
It's going to hatch! Hurry!

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.490
Okay! I've got it.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.070
Today's a special day,
so I'll finish it off fast!

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.120
Wah! B-but--

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.820
I feel so light today.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.820
This is the first time I've felt
so happy during a fight.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.450
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.870
Because... I'm not alone anymore!

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.760
Sorry for the wait!

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.720
You're just in time!

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.600
Be careful. It's coming!

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.530
Sorry to rain on your parade.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.990
But I'm going to finish you right here!

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:22.780
Got you!

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.540
You did it!

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.420
TIRO--

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:39.920
FINALE!!

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.570
It can't be...

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.000
You two! Make a contract
with me right now!!

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.210
Madoka! Sayaka!

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.460
Decide on a wish! Hurry!

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.920
That won't be necessary.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.350
I shall be the one to slay it.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.860
A moment later and you
would have been dead.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.780
Burn this sight into your minds.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.870
This is what it means to be a magical girl.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.100
...Give it back.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.980
Give it back! That--

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.690
That belongs to Mami...!

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.610
I said to give it back! Back to Mami!

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.780
That's right. This belongs
only to magical girls.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.700
Neither of you has any right to touch it.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.690
Itsuka kimi ga hitomi ni tomosu
The light of love

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.440
Ai no hikari ga
You will turn on in your eyes

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.310
Toki wo koete
Someday will go beyond time

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.360
Horobi isogu sekai no yume wo
And surely shatter a dream of the world

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.030
Tashika ni hitotsu kowasu darou
That is rushing towards destruction

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.820
Tamerai wo nomihoshite
What do you wish for

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.450
Kimi ga nozomu mono wa nani?
After swallowing up all of that hesitance?

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:01.420
Konna yokubukai akogare no yukue ni
Is there an ephemeral tomorrow

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.420
Hakanai ashita wa aruno?
At the end of this greedy admiration?

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.090
Kodomo no koro yume ni miteta
Using an ancient magic

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.930
Inishie no mahou no youni
That I used to dream of as a child

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:18.770
Yami sae kudaku chikara de
I want to break the darkness

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.600
Hohoemu kimi ni aitai
And see you smiling

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.440
Obieru kono te no naka niwa
The only thing left in my scared hand

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.320
Taorareta hana no yuuki
Is the courage of a broken flower

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.160
Omoi dake ga tayoru subete
All I can trust is my wish

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:45.840
Hikari wo yobisamasu negai
And my wish would awaken the light

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.430
Mami... was truly a kind-hearted person.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:05.190
To make us really understand what kind
of resolve we'd need in order to fight...

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.610
...she...

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:10.110
EPISODE 4: MIRACLES AND MAGIC ARE REAL

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.490
Miracles and magic are real.
